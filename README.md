# E-Commerce Database Project

## Overview
This project involves designing and implementing a comprehensive e-commerce database to support an online store. The database is designed to handle products, orders, users, payments, and more, with a focus on scalability, efficient data management, and robust relationships.

## Features
- **Product Catalog**: Manage products, categories, brands, and variations (e.g., colors, sizes).
- **User Management**: Store user details, including order and payment history.
- **Inventory System**: Track product quantities, orders, and shipping details.
- **Reviews & Ratings**: Allow customers to rate and review products.
- **Shipping & Payments**: Handle shipping addresses, payment statuses, and tracking information.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into the following components:
1. **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)**: A visual representation of the database schema, showing relationships between tables.
2. **SQL Schema**: SQL scripts to create tables, define primary and foreign keys, and enforce constraints.
3. **Sample Data**: SQL scripts to populate the database with realistic test data.

## Database Tables
The database includes the following tables:
- **brand**: Stores brand details.
- **product_category**: Stores product categories (e.g., clothing, electronics).
- **product**: Stores details of individual products.
- **product_item**: Represents purchasable items (e.g., size, color).
- **product_variation**: Links product items to their variations (e.g., color, size).
- **product_image**: Stores product image URLs.
- **product_attribute**: Stores custom product attributes (e.g., material, weight).
- **user**: Stores user information.
- **order**: Stores orders made by users.
- **order_items**: Stores individual items in an order.
- **payment**: Stores payment information for orders.
- **shipping**: Stores shipping details for each order.

## Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites
- **MySQL** (or any compatible RDBMS)
- **Git** to clone the repository

### Steps to Set Up the Database
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ecommerce-database.git
   ```
2. Import the SQL schema and sample data:
   - Open MySQL or your preferred database management tool.
   - Execute the `ecommerce.sql` file to create the tables:
     ```sql
     source ecommerce.sql;
     ```
   - Optionally, run the `sample_data.sql` file to populate the database with sample data:
     ```sql
     source sample_data.sql;
     ```

After running the SQL scripts, the database will be ready to use.

## Database Design

### Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)
The ERD provides a visual representation of the database schema, showing the relationships between tables. [Include a link or image of the ERD here.]

### Relationships
- **One-to-Many**: 
  - Between `brand` and `product`.
  - Between `product_category` and `product`.
- **Many-to-One**: 
  - Between `order` and `user`.
- **Many-to-Many**: 
  - Between `order` and `product` via the `order_items` table.
